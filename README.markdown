LaunchDoctor
============
I've got a PhD in [launchd][], and I'm not afraid to use it!

  [launchd]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd> "launchd on Wikipedia"

Usage
-----
LaunchDoctor is really simple. It is essentially an easy interface to
[launchd][]'s [property List][plist] files.

There are two ways to use LaunchDoctor - the simplest being directly
creating property lists and treating them as hashes:
    
    require 'launchdr'
    plist = LaunchDoctor::Launchd.new "name.elliottcable.launchdr.test"
    plist[:program_arguments] = ['/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator']
    plist.dump LaunchDoctor::Launchd::Paths[:user_agent]
    
The second is to use the common block idiom, provided by the `LaunchDoctor()`
method:
    
    require 'launchdr'
    LaunchDoctor "name.elliottcable.launchdr.test", :type => :user_agent do |plist|
      plist[:program_arguments] = ['/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator']
    end
    
LaunchDoctor can write (`dump`) the property lists to any place on your disk,
but the idiom method assumes you're going to want to use one of the
directories that launchd checks for property lists. These are stored in the
`Launchd::Paths` array.

LaunchDoctor also preforms some 'prettification' on the keys provided by
launchd's property list structure. All of the keys on the
[`launchd.plist` manpage][manpage] are available, but they can also be used as
true 'Ruby-ish' symbol keys. All of the following are legal:
    
    plist["UserName"] = "elliottcable"
    plist[:UserName] = "elliottcable"
    plist[:user_name] = "elliottcable"
    
I, personally, prefer the last one, because I looks more like I'm accessing a
normal Ruby `Hash`.
